## Overview

### The challenge

"Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles."

## My process

### What I learned

I learned how to make a scroll box and I also learned how to use Adobe Colors to find color trends. Moreover, I experimented with images. Finally, I learned not to use / before my stylesheet and images otherwise they wont load on Github pages.

### Continued development

I tried to incorporate a hidden checkbox as a CSS only solution to hide and show my HSL and RGB values. I couldn't quite get it to work how I wanted due to the set up of my HTML. I would like to return to this technique and try and implement it again in a future project. 

### Useful resources

- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - A great resource for colour palettes.
